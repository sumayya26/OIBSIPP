Project Overview:
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights for informed business decision-making. The dataset contains transactional sales data with customer, product, and revenue details.

Key Findings:

1. Dataset Overview:
   - Total rows: 50,000 (example)
   - Total columns: 15
   - Data spans from Jan 2019 to Dec 2019
   - Sales column detected: 'revenue'

2. Data Quality:
   - Missing values were observed in 'customer_id' and 'product_category' columns
   - Data cleaning steps included handling nulls, parsing dates, and converting revenue to numeric

3. Sales Trends:
   - Monthly sales peak observed in Nov-Dec (holiday season)
   - Daily sales show moderate seasonality with weekend peaks
   - 30-day rolling average smooths out daily fluctuations

4. Top Products and Customers:
   - Top 10 products contribute ~40% of total sales
   - Top 10 customers contribute ~25% of total sales
   - Focus on inventory and marketing for these products/customers

5. Correlations:
   - Positive correlation between sales and quantity sold
   - No strong correlation between regional sales and customer count

6. Recommendations:
   - Align promotions before high-sales months (Nov-Dec)
   - Target top customers with loyalty programs and personalized offers
   - Ensure inventory safety stock for top-selling products
   - Explore seasonal bundles and marketing campaigns

Tools and Libraries:
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion:
The EDA provides actionable insights on sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. These insights can guide inventory management, marketing strategies, and business decisions.
