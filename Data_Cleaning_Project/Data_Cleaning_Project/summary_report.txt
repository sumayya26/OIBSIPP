Project Overview:
This project involves cleaning the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset to ensure data quality and prepare it for analysis.

Key Steps:

1. Dataset Overview:
   - Rows: 49,000 (example)
   - Columns: 16
   - Contains listing info, neighborhood, price, minimum nights, number of reviews, etc.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values in columns like 'reviews_per_month' and 'name'
   - Standardized categorical columns like 'neighbourhood_group' and 'room_type'
   - Converted 'price' column to numeric, removing $ and commas
   - Created any derived columns needed for analysis

3. Observations:
   - Some listings have very high prices; considered as outliers
   - Missing reviews mostly for new or inactive listings
   - Neighborhood distribution is uneven (Manhattan highest listings)

4. Recommendations:
   - Remove or flag outliers in price for analysis
   - Impute or analyze missing reviews carefully
   - Standardize text columns to prevent duplicate categories

Tools and Libraries:
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion:
The dataset is now cleaned and ready for exploratory data analysis or modeling.
